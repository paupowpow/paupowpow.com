  the internet is so vast that i always appreciate getting a few pointers to the stuff that's really worthwhile to check out. i want to give back a little and also reflect more on what brings me joy, so here we go:
</p>

<h3>music</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href='https://gds.fm/' target="blank">GDS.FM</a> Zurich based 24/7 alternative music station featuring local and international artists, DJs and labels. I listen to it almost every day. </li>

  <li><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWouIh2R5Pk' target="blank">A playlist to feel like you're inside a Hopper painting</a> I've been getting into a specific type of playlists with names such as "studying like a scholar in the baroque period (playlist)" or "an hour of relaxing sponge bob music" or "you're high on mushrooms in the viking age, the gods are everywhere (playlist)". This David Hopper one is particularly nice, it gives me Twin Peak vibes too. YouTube (50 min)</li>
